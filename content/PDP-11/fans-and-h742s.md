Spent a lot of time over a couple weekends cleaning and reconditioning all the muffin cooling fans for the CPU cabinet and power supplies.  As you can see in the photo below, there are a lot of these!  All reassembled now, and wired along with the back-of-cabinet power distribution board.  Also did a clean on the big box fan at the top of the rack, not seen here.

I have also completely torn down the H742s to give them a thorough clean, touch up a few last corrosion spots, and replace the failing neon indicators.
