Title: PDP-11/45: H720E teardown and inspection

Started in on the H720E power supply that is part of RK05 storage system.  Just initial teardown, cleaning, and
inspection for obviously failed parts.  Looks pretty good, though there is a lot of dust and grime because this
unit lost its top cover plate somewhere over the years (I'll have to build some sort of replacement).

There are a couple of 22,000 mFD 50v electrolytic caps here that I'll try reforming before hitting them at full power,
since they've been sitting idle for upwards of 30yrs!  Also, one obviously leaking 330 mfd axial on regulator board, so
I'll replace this and all its identical twins.  Parts on order...
