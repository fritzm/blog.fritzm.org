Okay, the M9202 bus jumper arrived, and like the 2-foot BC11 cable, the occasional timeouts go away when this
is installed.  Hantek digital scope also arrived, so I decided to throw it on the backplane for a closer 
look at the SSYN and timeout signals.  The results were pretty interesting.  Here's a capture of an RKCS
access triggering a timeout glitch with the M902.  The yellow trace is BUS A SSYN L (taken from C12J1 on the 
11/45 backplane), and the blue trace is UBCB TIMEOUT (1) H (taken from D12U1):

What's interesting is that with the M9202 in place, the SSYN waveform shape on RCKS accesses is **not** 
significantly different -- and the timeout glitch ocurrs from time to time, but at a reduced amplitude:

If the problem had been one solely of lumped loads on the bus, I would have expected the fix to manifest
as a waveform difference, and for the glitches to have disappeared.  These observations steered me back
toward my original (less plausible?) supposition -- the the 74123 one-shot in the Unibus timeout logic in the
CPU was flaky, and particularly sensitive for some reason to SSYN pulses of 568ns.  Adding some extra bus 
length via a BC11 or the M9202 moves the timing by a nano or two off the troublesome period, and reduces the 
magnitude of the glitches.

So I went ahead and clipped out the suspect 74123, and put in a socket and a fresh part.  Bingo!  Timeout
glitching was eliminated entirely.  Here's a trace after the 74123 was replaced.  This trace looks different 
because with the timeout glitch fixed, I could no longer use it to trigger the scope -- instead I had to
trigger on the trailing edge of SSYN.  The scope is in persistent mode, and the different waveforms are
from RKCS and non-RKCS bus cycles.  In any case, the timeout glitching is now gone entirely:

So that's a nice result -- I think the new scope is going to be pretty useful.  The rather extreme sawtooth
on the falling edge of SSYN on RKCS accesses still looks pretty bad to me, even though it is no longer
triggering timeouts.  I might try swapping out the M105 address decoder on the RK11, which generates this
signal, and see if the integrity here is improved.  All for now!
