Title: PDP-11/45: Power Harness

The main bit I'm missing from the 11/45 is the power distribution harness; somewhere over the years this was
misplaced, or maybe I accidentally gave it away along with some excess 11/40 parts.  In any case, I haven't had any
luck tracking one of these down (made extra difficult by the fact that my 11/45 is an early model which requires a
slightly different harness than more recent models), so I'll have to build one myself from scratch.

Luckily the required harness is pretty well documented in the engineering print sets.  The crimp pins are standard
Mate-n-Lok still in production.  Some of the connectors are out of production, but they haven't been too hard to
track down.

Here are some pictures of the amassed wire of appropriate guages and colors, connectors, crimp pins, and the start of
the harness build on the bench:
