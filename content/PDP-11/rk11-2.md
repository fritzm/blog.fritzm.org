Okay, moving on with the RK11-C debug, the following bit of test code is modeled after that part of the
ZRKJE0 diagnotic that is trapping out:

            001000                          .END    START

Running this code, the error is easily reproduced -- the machine traps on a bus timeout and halts after 
anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred iterations.  Put the logic analyzer on MSYN and SSYN at the
back M105 address decode module on the RK11-C backplane and set up a trigger for long bus cycles, but
surprisingly this was not triggering even though the processor was taking a trap 4.  Verified that the
trigger itself was working fine by accessing a non-existent memory location from the front panel.  Hmmm...

Next step then was to move back to the CPU, and throw the UBC card out on extenders to get more visibility
into the trap.  A further surprise here -- the problem went away when the UBC was on the extender!  I was
able to run the test code above for hundreds of thousands of iterations without timeouts, and the original
ZRKJE0 diagnostic ran for over half an hour this way.

Took the UBC back off the extender, and the problem re-occurred, so apparently not just a bad seat.  Hooked
the logic analyzer up to BUS A MSYN L, BUS A SSYN L, and UBCB TIMEOUT (1) H on the 11/45 backplane.  With
this, I was able to capture lots of traces of the failure mode, which looks like this:

<img src='/images/pdp11/timeout-trace.jpg'/>

Here a glitch on the timeout signal is clearly visible, even though the MSYN/SSYN interval is well under
the bus timeout.  The interesting thing is that bus cycles that result in a glitch all have a MSYN/SSYN
interval of 568 nanosceconds, to within a nanosecond.  Cycles with a slightly different interval do not
timeout.  This jibes with what I saw with the card extender also.  As a further verification, replaced
the M920 bus jumper I'd been using with a 2-foot BC11, and the problem disappeared again.

At this point, Don over on the VCFED forum pointed out that the M920 I had been using was discontinued early
on due to negative effects on bus signal integrity, and was replaced with the M9202 (which itself contains 2 
feet of BC11).  The issue with the M920 is apprently that it provides so little separation that the connected
loads appear to the bus overall as a single lumped load.  The M9202 separates the loads on the bus to smear
out reflections and ringing and avoid false triggers.  I have tracked down an M9202 on eBay, and have also
put an inexpensive digital storage scope on order so I can start to investigate signal integrity issues like
this that are not apparent on a logic analyzer.
