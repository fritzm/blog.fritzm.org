The H742 supplies are now back together, mounted in the cabinet, and wired through to the 861.  I've powered them up and run them for minutes at a time (without any DC regulator loads) and there have been no surprise detonations...

The repainted cabinet side door has also been remounted.

Spent some time on the front panel as well.  Removed the tubular lock and took a trip to the local locksmith to have a new key made up.  Replaced all the incandescent indicator lamps with the closest modern equivalent.  Panel is now remounted and it's starting to look like a real '11!
