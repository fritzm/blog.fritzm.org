Title: PDP-11/45: LA30 repair IV
Date: 2017-12-9
Tags: Retro-Computing, PDP-11

Received replacement components for the blown G380 solenoid driver channel.  After this repair, all pins are
firing and printing correctly.  Calibrated left margin.  Checked pin drive signal, which was within
specifications and required no adjustment.

Went to check carriage return pulse timing calibrations, but as it turns out the G396 clock accelerator card
in this LA30 has not had ECO 2 applied and therefore has no timing calibration pots.  Carriage return seems to
be functioning correctly and reliably after the left margin adjustment in any case.

Inspected and cleaned the M7910 interface card; it appears to be in good shape.  Rejumpered the base address
and interrupt vector for console operation. Slotted it into the PDP-11 in place of the DL11 I had been using
up until now, and cabled up to the LA30.  Booted to the M9301 monitor and then on into RT-11, and everything
seems to be working fine!  Here's a short video of the RT-11 boot, followed by the start of a session of
Adventure:
