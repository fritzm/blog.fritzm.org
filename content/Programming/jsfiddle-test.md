Here's a small web toy, as a test of embedding a client-side visualisation in this blog.  The toy written in JavaScript using the [Three.js](http://threejs.org/) 3D graphics library, and is hosted at JSFiddle.net.  If you click the "Edit in JSFiddle" link, you'll go off site to a full multi-pane view of the toy, where you can inspect and modify and play with the various parts of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
